# CSE151B: Trajectory Prediction using Repeat-Linear Neural Network

Code: https://github.com/f6zhang/CSE-151B-Final-Project

Report: 

Summary:
This project is a class Kaggle Challenge (link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cse151b-spring# Global competition: https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/454/overview). In this project, we attemptted to solve the problem of Trajectory Prediction for autonomous driving. The goal is to predict the trajectory of the vehicle 3 seconds in the future using 2 seconds data in the past. Our group scored first place in public leaderboard with a test RMSE of less than 2.0 and scored second place in private leaderboard. 

Our group successfully developed two different neural network models to solve this problem. The first one is a repeat-layer linear model. This model is invented by me. It repeatly uses linear layers in the model to minimize the influence of vanishing gradient. The second model is encoder decoder model. For more details, please check the project code and report.

I crucially involved in all aspects of this project. I was responsible for the initial codebase, including loading and preparing the data, training, validating and testing the model. I proposed and wrote our first model, repeat-layer linear model. I was also responsible for hyperparameters tuning for both models. And I was responsible for writing the majority of the report.
